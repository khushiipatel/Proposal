# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Analysists Possibilities 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

We are going to use RenPy, to create multiple choose your own adventure games. There will be a point system, and the player has to make the correct decision to "survive"/ get points. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We will be using Renpy to add visual aspects to our project. It will enable us to add sound effects, animations. etc and help us make our project visually appealing. We will be extensively using for loops, dictionaries and random features as well. This will help us to generate random possibilities from a list of options that we feed into our program.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

-We will have three different storylines, each with at least three stages.
-Point system
-Animation on each stage
-Randomness aspect

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In addition to above high quality animation, character preference by user, adding 4 plus strategies. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We hope accomplishing character development, audio/sound effects as per to the stories, and seting the highest scores gained by the user. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We will each be working on individual story lines and title. We need to research RenPy and how to make that work.
